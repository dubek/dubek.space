title: "KVM Forum 2021 talks on Confidential Computing"
---

As part of work done at IBM Research on Confidential Computing (specifically
with AMD SEV), I participated in two talks presented in KVM Forum 2021.

The first one deals with securing the boot process of memory-encrypted Linux
VMs.  It describes changes we contirbuted to OVMF and QEMU.

The second talk describes the challenges of live migration in SEV and SEV-ES
guests and our attempts to tackle them.  This is still work-in-progress.
